	<h1>Biomechanics</h1>
	
	<p> <b>Biomechanics:</b> the use of the mechanical principles of physics and engineering to study human motion and the mechanical properties of biological tissues. </p>
	<p> <b>Sports Biomechanics:</b> the study of movement in sporting situations. </p>
	<p> <b>Occupational Biomechanics:</b> the study of movement in work environments. </p>
	<p> <b>Clinical Biomechanics:</b> the study of movement in rehabilitation settings. </p>
	<p> <b>Neuromechanics:</b> interactions between the nervous system and mechanical properties of the body. </p>
	<p> <b>Motor Control:</b> to understand how movements of the human body are controlled and executed, and how motor skills develop through the lifespan and are acquired through practice. </p>
	<p> <b>Sports Medicine:</b> the prevention and treatment of injuries and disorders that are related to participation in sports. </p>
